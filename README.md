# Web Portfolio

This is my [Web Portfolio](https://gocaspt.github.io/WebPortfolio).

I use [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) to deploy the React code to GitHub Pages, which hosts the website. To use this feature, you can refer to the repository [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) for instructions on how to set it up.
